# three-js-kunalrgarg (Park Fireworks)

# Information
Name: Kunal Garg
Project Name: Park Fireworks (PennVR Three.js project)
GitHub Pages Site: https://pennvr.github.io/three-js-kunalrgarg/

# Techniques: 
Using perlin noise, I was able to generate a randomly elevated terrain. This smooth random surface allowed me to give the user an impression of being on a hilly surface. I used this technique because it is the most straightforward and commonly used noise function. I used basic geometry position moevement to manually move the fireworks every frame. I used this strategy as I did not know how to use force/velocity to move the fireworks.

# Instructions on building/running the code: 
I started my project by 
To view the VR experience, clone the projet and open the index.html file in firefox nightly. Or you can open the GitHub Pages site on chromium/firefox nightly.

# Motion Sickness: 
While I did not feel a sense of motion sickness while in the VR experience for a short period of time. My friend felt motion sickness after wearing the oculus for an extended period of time.

# Assignment's Most Difficult task: 
I felt that getting started and aquainting myself with javascript, threejs documentation, and even git was problbay the most difficult task. I spent a majority of the time leanring the tools avaiable to me rather than applying them towards the project.

# What I wish I had done differently: 
I wish I had started earlier and worked towards a velocity/force based firework. I also wish I had cleaned the project by moving the fireworks functions to another class.

# What I was different about the assignemnt: 
I wish the directions were a little more clear as to what would earn me minimum points and what would earn me full credit. Additionally I wish we worked through more examples in class. Trung's walkthrough really helped me understand basics. Overall I felt that there was a huge learning curve, but I feel that I learned a lot in the process and am glad that I completed the assignment.
