# three-js-kunalrgarg

Name: Kunal Garg
Project Name: PennVR Three.js project
GitHub Pages Site: https://github.com/kunalrgarg
Techniques: Using perlin noise, I was able to generate a randomly elevated terrain. This smooth random surface allowed me to give the user an impression of being on a hilly surface.

Instructions: clone the projet and open the index.html file in firefox nightly

Motion Sickness: While there is not any sense of motion sickness while in the VR experience for a short period of time. I noticed that a friend felt a sense of motion sickness after wearing the oculus for an extended period of time.

Assignment's Most Difficult task: I felt that getting started and aquainting myself with javascript, threejs documentation, and even git was problbay the most difficult task. I spent a majority of the time leanring the tools avaiable to me rather than applying them towards the project.

What I wish I had done differently: I wish I had started earlier and worked towards a velocity/force based firework. I also wish I had cleaned the project by moving the fireworks functions to another class.

What I was different about the assignemnt: I wish the directions were a little more clear as to what would earn me minimum points and what would earn me full credit. Additionally I wish we worked through more examples in class. Trung's walkthrough really helped me understand basics. Overall I felt that there was a huge learning curve, but I feel that I learned a lot in the process and am glad that I completed the assignment.
